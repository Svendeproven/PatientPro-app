A app for nearces to help administrate patients, by providing a todo for the tasks to be done for each patient. With this app it also provides the ability to scan a patients bracelet, either by QR-code or NFC-chip.

## Architecture and design
The code structure is made up of the following folders:
```
├───lib
│   ├───components
│   ├───services
│   ├───theme
│   ├───models
│   ├───views
|   |───viewmodels

```
The architecture is based on the MVVM pattern. The views are the pages that are shown to the user. The viewmodels are the logic that is used to control the views. The models are the data that is used in the app. The services are the services that are used to communicate with the backend. The components are the widgets that are used in the views.

## Getting started
To get started with the app, you need to have flutter installed. You can find the installation guide [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). After installing flutter, you can clone the repository and run the app on your device or emulator.
